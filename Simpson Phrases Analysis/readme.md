# Simpson's Phrases Analysis

### Description
Created an analysis of the American TV show "The Simpsons" to find the famous phrases uttered most in this show.
Downloaded the data from Kaggle which had 4 different datasets and created relationships between each dataset.
Tried to find the Location, Episodes and the person(including the number of times) who uttered the selected phrase in the show

Cleaned the CSV data in powerBI  by removing null values and by trimming unwanted space
in all the column values to perform analysis on cleaned data.

From our analysis, we found that the phrase "Homer"(from the list of phrases we had) was uttered(4116 times) the maximum number times and it was max uttered 28times(the maximum for a location) at Barney's Bowlarama alone

We could do similar analysis on our favorite TV shows or movies to find the famous phrases uttered in them which will help to narrow down the episode we need and leanr interesting facts about how many times they were uttered.
